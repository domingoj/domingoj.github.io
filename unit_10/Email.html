      	<h2>New Silver Peak Campaign</h2>
      	<p>I'm excited to share my latest project involving the develpment of a fun brand campaign for Silver Peak. The over arching campaign concept was "If you're using conventional routers, you are using technology from the 80's". This allowed for a lot of retro fun in getting the message out there. We developed a video and supporting online presence that linked to the video as well as a variety of addtional initiatives that resulted in some great click throughs and brand presence for Silver Peak</p>
